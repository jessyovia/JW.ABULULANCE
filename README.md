# JW.Abulance

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to **JW-Abulance**, a project I’m building to help make emergency medical services faster and more reliable. The idea is to simplify how ambulances are assigned and tracked during emergencies.  

## What’s This About?

- 🚑 **Dispatch System**: Quickly send the nearest ambulance to where it’s needed.  
- 🗺️ **Real-Time Tracking**: See where the ambulance is and how soon it’ll arrive.  
- ✅ **Simple to Use**: Both patients and responders get a clean, easy-to-navigate interface.  
- 🔒 **Secure Data**: Patient and request info are safely stored and handled.

## My purpose of doing this;

I’ve always been passionate about using technology to solve real-life problems, and JW-Abulance is one way I’m exploring that. My goal is to create something that could actually save lives by reducing response time in emergencies.
